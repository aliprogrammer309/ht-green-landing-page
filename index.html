              Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs
              with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat pump and
              youre still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let
              HT Green work with you to design and install a system that uses
              solar, wind or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power
              bill for now and into the future.

                Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth
                is warmer than the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT
                Green can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you
                free plentiful home warming energy year-round.

              <p>
                Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and
                environmentally friendly, but has previously been geographically
                limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent
                technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and
                size of viable resources, especially for direct applications
                such as home heating.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep
                within the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those
                of conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has
                the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed
                instead of fossil fuels.

                If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to
                engineer a wind turbine system that generates electricity when
                the wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system and
                you increase your energy generation potential.

                New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind
                turbine works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind
                turbine is installed.
